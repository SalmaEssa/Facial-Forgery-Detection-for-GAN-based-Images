# Facial-Forgery-Detection-for-GAN-based-Images
this application that takes an image and determines whether the image is fake or real, It implements a two-step pairwise learning approach to learn common fake features over the training images generated by
using different generative models. First, the triplet loss will be used to simulate the relation between fake and real images and utilize to learn
the discriminative features. Then, we develop a coupled network to accurately capture local and global image features of the fake or real images
